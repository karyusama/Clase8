        <p>French writer wrote short stories. He was an author of the naturalist and realist schools of writing and is best known for his short stories, which are considered highly influential on much of modern literature.
        Maupassant is often described as the father of the modern short story—a literary form that's more condensed and immediate than the novel. His work was admired by his contemporaries and imitated by those who came after him.</p>
        <p id="p_texto2"> Other than writing he didn't have many other interests. </p>
